            <h2>My name is Jerrell and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

            <p><strong>I use to be "spend-a-holic"</strong>. I would purchase so many things that I thought
                that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
            <p>Things were terrible, my priorities I had none! I was spending money that should have been invested
                in assests, but i was purchasing junk all while still living at home with my parents. Life wasn't
                good for me then.</p>

            <h3 class="about-subtitle">How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown</strong>. I literally sold 90% of my possessions and moved into
                a small apartment.</p>
            <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a place, I didn't know what else to do.
                Yet, it worked.</p>

            <h3 class="about-subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoying life and my
                family more,
                and I have more free time and gained financial literacy.</p>
            <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I
                    did it</strong>,
                and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
